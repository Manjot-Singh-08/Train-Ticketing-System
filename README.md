# Train-Ticketing-System
Train Ticketing System is a python based project. I have developed Train Ticketing System using tkinter package. The main modules available in this project are Class (Standard, Economy, and First Class), Destination Selector, and Ticket Type along with applicable taxes. It is very easy to use and understand. This simple console based Ticket Reservation system provides one of the simplest reservations of ticket. There is no database connection in this mini project to save userâ€™s data permanently and retrieve it. In order to run the project, you must have installed Python, on your PC.
